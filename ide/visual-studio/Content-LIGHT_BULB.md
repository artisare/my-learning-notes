## Quick Action
**Light Bulbs** are a new feature for Visual Studio 2015 to allow developers refactoring code inline. When there is an error indicated by a red squiggle, a light bulb will appear too if there are fixes available for that error.

Light Bulbs are an easy way to fix common warnings quickly and effectively. To access them, right-click on a warning squiggle (or press Ctrl+. while mouse-hovering over the squiggle), and then select **Quick Actions**.
