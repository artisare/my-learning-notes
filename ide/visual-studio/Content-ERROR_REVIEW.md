# Error Review

**Error List Window** gives developer a more organized view of the errors and warnings for the project.

Click on the error line in the Error List window and jump to the line the error occurs in. Alternatively, we can click on the hyperlinked error code value in the Code column of the Error List. This will launch a Bing search for just the error code.

We can choose the Errors, Warnings, and Messages tabs to see different levels of information.

## Error List Filters

There are two types of filter in two dropdown boxes, one on the right side of the toolbar and one to the left of the toolbar.

The dropdown list on the left side of the toolbar specifies the set of code files to use (**Entire Solution**, **Open Documents**, **Current Project**, **Current Document**).

The dropdown list on the right side of the toolbar specifies whether to show errors from the **Build Only** (errors resulting from a build operation) or from the **IntelliSense Only** (errors detected before running a build), or from both **Build + IntelliSense**.
