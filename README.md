# Going from Good to Great: Becoming a Better Software Developer

> I am a software developer working in [Singapore Changi Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Changi_Airport). As you can tell from the company name, firstly, it is not in Silicon Valley, dream place for software developer. Secondly, it is not a software/tech company. So working here means I'm not being technically mentored by a great software developer. I can only guess how to do things the correct way which is good enough to support the business needs.
> 
> Working in the airport helps me to gain experience in software development. Even though my main focus is web development, I also work on cloud computing, mobile apps, and IoT projects. However, since it's not a software development company, we have no plan, guidance, and best practices to follow. I feel that I am missing some important experience such as constructing quality software with a professional software team. 
>
> To overcome this, as a fan of self-learning, I thus choose to spend after office hour to learn new skills and new information in order to keep up with the fast-paced changes in software development field. So, I create this repository to not only share what I've learned, but also to learn from contributors to this notes so we can learn together. =) 

## My Learning Journey

 - [ASP .NET MVC](/aspnet/mvc)
 - Microsoft Azure
 - Visual Studio
 - UI/UX
 - SCSS
 - Windows 10 IoT
 - Unit Testing
 - ASP .NET Core
 - Django and Python
 - NodeJS with MEAN Stack
 - AngularJS
 - ReactJS
 - Readings and Books
 
## Why?
I actually have a blog at [https://cuteprogramming.wordpress.com](https://cuteprogramming.wordpress.com) sharing about my learning experience and personal hobby projects. However it's not detailed enough. Hence, insprired by [ZuzooVn's Top-down learning path: Machine Learning for Software Engineers](https://github.com/ZuzooVn/machine-learning-for-software-engineers), I decided to keep my detailed learning notes in this Github repository instead while my blog will only give overview about what I've learned.
